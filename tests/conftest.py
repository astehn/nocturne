"""Qt tests run headless by default.

The fullscreen tests call `_toggle_fullscreen()` on a window that has been
`show()`n, and on macOS `showFullScreen()` takes over an entire screen — so
running the suite made the machine unusable until it finished. Roughly ten other
tests flash a window for the same reason.

The offscreen platform plugin builds real widgets and delivers real events; it
simply never composites them to a display. Everything CLAUDE.md says about
verifying GUI state by sending Qt events to a real window and reading the widget
back still holds — only the pixels on your monitor go away. Measured on the full
suite: 1345 passed either way, 13 s faster headless.

`setdefault`, not assignment, so you can still watch a test run:

    QT_QPA_PLATFORM=cocoa .venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/ui/test_main_window.py -q

This must run before anything constructs a QApplication — the platform plugin is
chosen at construction, and pytest imports the root conftest before collecting
tests or creating the `qapp` fixture.
